This project is to scrape multiple web pages from IMDB to filter top rated movies in the year 2000s based on IMDB ratings and metascores. The scrapping is done in Python using BeautifulSoup and requests. We’ll then perform some simple analysis using pandas, and matplotlib.

Some basic understanding of HTML is necessary as well as a good grasp of Python’s basics. Thanks!
