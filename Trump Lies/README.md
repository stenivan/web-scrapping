I worked on this project based on the tutorial that I've found on Youtube '[Web Scrapping in Python with Beautiful Soup and requests](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IDbOi0g5WFh1YPDNzXw4LNL)' by Data School. It's a really nice and easy-to-understand tutorial that I'll be using a lot as I continue to do more web scrapping projects. Thanks and hope you find it helpful too!
